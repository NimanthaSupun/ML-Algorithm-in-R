# First, the code assigns the Iris dataset to a variable named dataset and uses the View() function to display the dataset in a spreadsheet-like format. This allows the user to visually inspect the data.

# Next, the code applies the k-means clustering algorithm to the dataset, excluding the species column (the fifth column). The kmeans() function is called with two arguments: the dataset without the species column (dataset[,-5]) and the number of clusters to form, which is set to 3. The result of this clustering operation is stored in the results variable.

# The results$size line retrieves the size of each cluster, indicating how many data points are assigned to each cluster. This provides insight into the distribution of data points across the clusters.

# The table() function is then used to create a contingency table comparing the actual species of the iris flowers (dataset$Species) with the cluster centers obtained from the k-means algorithm (results$centers). However, this line contains an error because results$centers should be replaced with results$cluster to correctly compare the species with the assigned clusters.

# Finally, two scatter plots are generated using the plot() function. The first plot visualizes the clustering results by plotting petal length against petal width and coloring the points according to the cluster assignments (results$cluster). The second plot visualizes the actual species by plotting the same attributes but coloring the points according to the species (dataset$Species). These plots help in visually comparing the clustering results with the actual species classification.
